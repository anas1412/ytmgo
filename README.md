## Install

One line does everything — grabs the static binary for your OS/arch, installs it, and auto-installs `mpv` if it's missing (using `sudo` for system package managers):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://anas1412.github.io/ytmgo/install.sh | bash
```

> Override the install dir: `YTMGO_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/bin curl ... | bash`

Or build from source (after installing `mpv` yourself):

```bash
go build -o ytmgo .
./ytmgo
```

## Features

- **Search from the terminal** — No browser, no tabs. Search, pick, and queue without leaving your terminal.
- **Download in one key** — Press `x` on any track and it downloads. Queue-friendly, one at a time, with progress feedback.
- **Favorites page** — `f` to bookmark. Dedicated page to browse them all. Heart shows on every favorited track.
- **Full mouse support** — Click tabs, click panels, click the progress bar to seek. Most terminal apps can't do this.
- **Discord Rich Presence** — Show what you're listening to — track, artist, play status — live on your Discord profile.
- **Static binary, no bloat** — Pure Go, no Electron, no browser engine. Starts instantly, sips RAM, gets out of your way.

## Prerequisites

- **Go** 1.22+
- **mpv** — audio playback backend
- **yt-dlp** — YouTube / YouTube Music streaming URL resolution and downloads
- **ffmpeg** — audio extraction for downloads (yt-dlp dependency)

### Install system dependencies

These are required for playback and downloads:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install mpv yt-dlp ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install mpv yt-dlp ffmpeg

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S mpv yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

> yt-dlp is the core download engine — it searches YouTube Music for the track and streams/downloads the audio. ffmpeg is used by yt-dlp for audio extraction.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project
cd ytmgo

# Build
go build -o ytmgo .

## Usage

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Press `Tab` to focus the search input |
| 2 | Type a query and press `Enter` |
| 3 | Browse results in the left panel (`↑↓` / `jk`) |
| 4 | Press `Enter` on a result to add to queue + start download |
| 5 | `Tab` to the queue panel, select a track, press `Enter` to play |
| 6 | Control playback with keys (see below) |

Tab cycles focus through: search input → result list → queue panel → settings — and the focused panel's border glows violet.

**Mouse support** — Click header tabs to switch pages, click list items to select, double-click to activate, click the progress bar to seek, and click the controls row to play/pause, adjust volume, or toggle shuffle/repeat.
