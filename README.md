## Install

One line does everything — grabs the static binary for your OS/arch, installs it, and auto-installs `mpv`/`yt-dlp`/`ffmpeg` if they're missing (using `sudo` for system package managers):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://anas1412.github.io/ytmgo/install.sh | bash
```

> Override the version: `YTMGO_VERSION=v0.2.0 curl ... | bash`
> Override the install dir: `YTMGO_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/bin curl ... | bash`

Or build from source (after installing `mpv`/`yt-dlp`/`ffmpeg` yourself):

```bash
go build -o ytmgo .
./ytmgo
```

## Features

- **YouTube Search** — Search YouTube directly from the terminal via `yt-dlp`
- **Audio Download** — Download tracks as MP3s with real-time progress
- **Play Queue** — Full queue management: reorder, shuffle, repeat (one / all)

- **Keyboard-driven TUI** — Tab-focused layout with vim navigation + mouse support (click tabs, panels, progress bar, and settings)
- **Concurrency-safe** — Mutex-guarded queue, single-playback lock, serial download pipeline

## Usage

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Press `Tab` to focus the search input |
| 2 | Type a query and press `Enter` |
| 3 | Browse results in the left panel (`↑↓` / `jk`) |
| 4 | Press `Enter` on a result to add to queue + start download |
| 5 | `Tab` to the queue panel, select a track, press `Enter` to play |
| 6 | Control playback with keys (see below) |

Tab cycles focus through: search input → result list → queue panel → settings — and the focused panel's border glows violet.

**Mouse support** — Click header tabs to switch pages, click list items to select, double-click to activate, click the progress bar to seek, and click the controls row to play/pause, adjust volume, or toggle shuffle/repeat.
